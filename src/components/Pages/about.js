                    NITSMUN was founded in 2014 when a group of like-minded
                    people wanted to create a society for younger people to
                    discuss, debate, and deliberate present-day crises whilst
                    experiencing themselves being in the shoes of various world
                    leaders. Ever since the first MUN session in 2014, our
                    society has grown manifold with more enthusiastic people
                    joining in and helping us emerge as one the best and most
                    promising MUN societies in NE India. Our conference offers
                    its delegates an unrivaled Model UN experience by running
                    highly personalized, engaging, and dynamic committees.

                    Besides having participated in various MUNs in and around
                    the country and bringing home numerous accolades and
                    valuable experience, we have also hosted MUNs every single
                    year since, with multiple mock sessions and collaborative
                    conferences with world-class universities, with
                    awe-inspiring members of the EB training and guiding us to
                    think rationally, act quickly and solve modern-day problems
                    and at the same time also provide us with the support
                    required. NITSMUN aims at polishing the interpersonal,
                    debating, and deliberating skills of the participants and
                    mold them into a leader of tomorrow.

                    A Model United Nations is an academic simulation of the
                    United Nations. Students act as delegates and discuss
                    real-world problems. These simulations are conducted by
                    various universities, colleges, and schools to elevate the
                    debating, presentation, oratory, deliberative skills of
                    students and acquaint them with the pressing ongoing
                    problems in the world and give them an opportunity to
                    brainstorm and try finding solutions to them, whilst keeping
                    in mind their foreign policies. Every conference has
                    different committees and each committee discourses upon a
                    certain agenda and tries to find fixes and solutions to the
                    problems.
